    <h3>Before We Start</h3>
    <h4>Important To Remember</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>You won't understand everything right away and it is ok</li>
      <li>If you don't know something, try to find the answer yourself (answers are in forums, documentations, books, etc)</li>
      <li>Always write notes with explanations and descriptions of topics which will help in the long run</li>
      <li>Spend time by yourself creating something from the a blank empty start and practice on what you've encountered</li>
      <li>Do something fun and you might need something new to make it work but it is ok to find what you need by yourself to discover new answers or solutions</li>
      <li>Start with a lot of small easy work at first and then increase the size and difficulty slowly</li>
      <li>Experiment on why things are not working and find the meaning of errors, their causes and how to solve those errors</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What is HTML</h3>
    <p>HTML is <strong>used</strong> to display content in the web browser and the content's looks or appearance can be modified with the help of CSS. HTML can also be modified by JavaSciprt which can give it life by allowing users to interact with HTML elements and change the behavior of the website or webapp by allowing actions depeding on the code inside the JavaSciprt file and HTML elements can be removed, added or modified in appearance easily with JavaScipt. The user can also receive or input data which is processed by the JavaScript code.</p>
