- reserved keywords - words that the compiler identifies as having a specific meaning which makes them unavailable to be used in naming variables or functions

- function - may be a user-defined or pre-built function that executes whatever code block it contains by using a function call and can be spotted because of an open and close parenthesis near its name

- `alert()` - a function that will make a dialog box to pop up with a message
```js
alert("A cloud weighs around a million tonnes");
```

- `<script>` - usually used when connecting a javascript file to an html file

Add inside <body> but place it at the very last line of <body> in the html file
`<script src="script.js"></script>`

- comments - descriptions or labels that are ignored by the compiler and help explain the purpose of each code
```js
// line comment
// Giraffes are 30 times more likely to get hit by lightning than people

// multi-line comment
/*
Earth’s rotation is changing speed. It's actually slowing. This means that, on average, the length of a day increases by around 1.8 seconds per century
*/
```
